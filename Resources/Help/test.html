    <p><strong>Virtual Adil</strong> is a software program created by DaphAdil Consulting for keeping track of a shipping company&#39;s clients and work orders. This help page will provide you with instructions on how to use the various components of the software and diagrams showing the function of certain components.</p>

    <h2 id="home-page">Home Page</h2>
    <p>This is the first page the user will see when they launch the application, sometimes known as a <em>splash screen</em>. This page simply acts as a welcoming graphic for the user, and a notification that it is ready to use. To start using Virtual Adil, click on one of the other tabs at the top of the application window. </p>

    <p><img src="managecustomer.jpg" alt="managecustomer-visual"></p>
    <p>The <strong>Manage Customers</strong> tab is where new customers are added to the Customer table. The user can also use this window to make changes to existing customer records. The left side of the window allows the user to interact with each field of data, while the right side displays a list of existing records in the Virtual Adil database, along with controls that allow the user to sort and search the fields.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note: Database Terms</strong> <br>A full customer entry (including name, address, phone number, etc.) is referred to as a <strong>record</strong> in this document. <br>A single bit of information (like Zip Code) is called a <strong>field</strong>. A full customer <strong>record</strong> is made up of ten <strong>fields</strong>. <br>All of the <strong>records</strong> combined make up the full Customer <strong>table</strong>, which, like the Orders <strong>table</strong>, is part of the Virtual Adil <strong>database</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Create Orders</strong> tab is where new orders are added to the Orders table. <br>Across the top is customer information, which can be pulled in by selecting a customer in the dropdown menu in the far upper left. <br>Pickup and Dropoff Information specify the address information for the work order&#39;s origin and destination, and can be quickly filled out by using the Copy Customer Data control. <br>Booking Date keeps track of the date the order was received, and Pickup/Delivery Date reflect the date of pickup and dropoff. All three dates must be in the proper order (dropoff date cannot be before pickup date, for example). <br>Description and Special Instructions in the lower right are for any notes the user would like to add to the order. <br>Finally, the Order Status allows the user to flag a job as Pending, In Transit, Delayed, Complete, or Cancelled. The user can then use the Search Orders tab to search for orders by this status (for example, list all jobs that are Complete).</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note: Database Terms</strong> <br>A full work order entry (including pickup, dropoff, status, etc.) is referred to as a <strong>record</strong> in this document. <br>A single bit of information (like Booking Date) is called a <strong>field</strong>.

    <ol>
    <li>Use the customer dropdown menu in the upper left to select a customer. <strong>Customers must be created in the Manage Customers tab before their information can be pulled into a Work Order.</strong></li>
    <li>Make any necessary edits to the fields if there are changes specific to this work order. (Permanent edits to customer records can be performed in the <strong>Manage Customer</strong> tab.)</li>
    <li>Fill out the Pickup Information section with the address of the pickup location. Clicking &quot;Copy Customer Data&quot; will pull the information in the fields at the top into these fields.</li>
    <li>Repeat Step 3 for the Dropoff Information section. You can change the customer listed at the top between Steps 3 and 4 to pull in different information.</li>
    <li>Specify the Booking, Pickup, and Delivery dates. Dates are checked to make sure they are in chronological order.</li>
    <li>Fill out Description and Special Instructions if desired; then choose an Order Status.</li>
    <li>Hit Save Order to save the order into the database.</li>

    <p>At any time, you can hit Cancel to discard your changes and leave the database unchanged.</p>
